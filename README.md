# ProductionWeaver

An application designed for independent film production management.

## Motivation

Most film productions are not cheap! As the independent film movement continues
to grow all over the globe, indie filmmakers are required to make vital decisions
on where to skimp and where to allocate their funds, often times working with
shoestring budgets.

A common frustration is the cost of quality production management software.
ProductionWeaver is here to provide indie filmmakers a truly cost effective
way to manage productions from script breakdown, shot listing, budgeting, etc. 

ProductionWeaver is currently in the early stages of development with the
script breakdown feature being the first to be released.
